In the store folder we will create all the store classes, which is a cache of a
collection of Models. They are very similar to DAO (Data Access Object);
classes used on server-side languages to perform CRUD operations on the
database. And as Ext JS does not communicate directly with databases, the
store classes are used to communicate with the server side or a local storage
used with a proxy (Proxies are used by Stores to handle the loading and
saving of the Model data).
