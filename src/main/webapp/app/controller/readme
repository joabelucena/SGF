And finally, in the controller folder we will handle all the events fired by
the components (events fired because of the life cycle of the component or
because of some interaction of the user with a component). We always need
to remember that Ext JS is event driven, and on the Controller classes we
will control these events and update any Model, View, or Store (if needed).
